\begin{rubric}{About me} \end{rubric}
\section{}
I am a passionate and motivated software engineering student at the University of Colombo School of Computing, aspiring to become a skilled full-stack software developer. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world solutions and continuously learning new technologies to expand my capabilities.
With hands-on experience in the MERN stack, Spring Boot, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML/CSS, PHP, and SQL, I have worked on several personal and academic projects, as well as two industrial-level projects that enhanced my understanding of real-world software development practices.
I am driven by a strong interest in building efficient, user-friendly applications—whether it’s front-end interfaces or robust back-end systems. My goal is to become a versatile developer who can contribute meaningfully across the entire development life cycle.
